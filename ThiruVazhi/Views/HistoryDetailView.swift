Though we are not aware of the exact time Thirukkural was composed, people believe that it was between the 3rd century BCE and 1st century CE, well over 2,000 years. Thirukkural consists of 1,330 couplets (Kurals), arranged into 133 chapters, each containing 10 couplets. These Kurals contain ethical and moral values applicable to all aspects of life. Anyone can relate themselves with each Kural, regardless of their religion, caste or region."
