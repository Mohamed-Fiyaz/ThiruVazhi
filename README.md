# ThiruVazhi - A Traditionally Inspired Thirukkural App

## Overview
ThiruVazhi is a culturally inspired Thirukkural app that digitally presents the ancient wisdom of 1,330 couplets, originally preserved in palm leaf manuscripts (Olaichuvadi) by Thiruvalluvar. The app features a traditionally inspired UI/UX, allowing users to explore chapters, themes, and translations of Thirukkurals in a user-friendly and searchable format while preserving Tamilâ€™s cultural heritage.

## UI/UX Design
The Kural card and chapter card designs replicate the aesthetic of palm leaf manuscripts. SwiftUI was used for these designs due to its declarative UI syntax and state management capabilities. The app stores user preferences for showing or hiding Tamil text using UserDefaults from the Foundation framework, ensuring persistence.
